  <h1><i>Ruins</i> <BR> Grouper & First Aid Kit</h1>
  <p class="subtitle1">
    <i>genre:</i> ambient-folk, folk-country <br>
    <i>autres: Leonard Cohen</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    It would be remiss to review First Aid Kit’s <i>Ruins</i> (2018) without simultaneously considering Grouper’s <i>Ruins</i> (2014).<br><br>

    Grouper’s <i>Ruins</i> is six seconds longer than First Aid Kit’s, albeit two songs less (and four years prior.) Grouper is the work of Liz Harris, who is based in Oregon. First Aid Kit is the work of siblings Johanna and Klara Söderberg, who are based in Sweden. Harris travelled to Portugal for a residency to record all but one of the songs on the album, while First Aid Kit travelled to Oregon to record their <i>Ruins</i>.<br><br>

    On November 7 2016, Leonard Cohen passed. In March of 2017, First Aid Kit held two tribute concerts to his work. Similarly, Harris was listening to Cohen, among other musicians, during the recording of <i>Ruins</i>.<br><br>

    Grouper’s begins with the ominous incantation “Made of Metal." Ghostemane has made analogous assays in </i>Hexada</i> (2017) and <i>Plagues</i> (2016). Ruins ends with the long-ambient “Made Of Air." It’s a stylish choice; preceding it are Wilco’s <i>A Ghost Is Born</i> (2004) and Arcade Fire’s <i>Reflektor</i> (2013) with their drone deaths. Let the album decay, reflect on its own arc.<br><br>

    I want to say that there’s not a stylistic continuum- that the overt classic country nostalgia of First Aid Kit’s Ruins is not more indicative of perennial human experiences. That the degeneration and dawn of genre exhibited by Grouper’s Ruins is also inextricable from its predecessors. Lost love, emotional soup, time and place tied up in an irrevocable knot of romanticism; it's all there, just delivered differently.<br><br>

    Aural originality has little place in this particular discourse; instead, how does a person process the affront and affect of classful Western life? Here lie two Ruins, monoliths of practicality- engrave art into a media, and move on. Two extraordinarily beautiful albums that give me frisson; albums I can commune and commiserate with. Ordinary experience.<br><br>

    The stentorian start of the first verse in “Distant Star” is mirrored by its incisive end:<br>

            Your mother, she's an actress <br>
            And we're all putting on a play <br>
            Here's some conviction, pretend it's all real <br>
            Try to ignore how sad it all feels <br>
            Yes, try not to break her heart if you can <br>

    The lines are multifarious, and continue a canon of criticism against domesticity, married life, and the mutual fantasy of love. This may be a socio-political commentary on the roleplaying that some people participate in. It’s reminiscent of Henrik Ibsen’s play <i>A Doll’s House</i>, in which the protagonist, Nora, is disillusioned with the plainness of home life and the mutual fantasy of marriage. An adjacent allusion may be to Gustave Flaubert’s <i>Madame Bovary</i>, which is a story of the emptiness of fantasy. I’m reminded of the last verse in Father John Misty’s “Holy Shit”<br>

          Oh, and love is just an institution based on human frailty <br>
          What's your paradise gotta do with Adam and Eve? <br>
          Maybe love is just an economy based on resource scarcity <br>
        </p>

    Alternating between the albums, I recognize that I have a much stronger connection to Grouper’s <i>Ruins</i>. Reduce it irreverently to a romanticization of solitude- the reclusive response to sorrow. Reduce it to #mood. The powerful, well-adjusted <i>Ruins</i> of First Aid Kit are an extra-terrestrial terrain. Detritus of disaffection/disconnection? Experiencing and holding hurt with others? A beautiful ballad to bear one’s burden? A holy star to guide me, whose grace elides me.
